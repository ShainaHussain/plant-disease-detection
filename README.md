# Plant Disease Detection ðŸŒ±

Deep Learning project to detect diseases in plants using Convolutional Neural Networks.

## Project Goal
Build an end-to-end system that can identify 38 different plant diseases from leaf images.

## Tech Stack
- PyTorch
- OpenCV
- Streamlit (for deployment)
- Python

## Dataset
PlantVillage Dataset - 54,000+ images of healthy and diseased plant leaves

## Status
ðŸš§ Work in Progress - Week 1

## Progress
- [x] Day 1: Setup & Data Exploration
- [ ] Model Training
- [ ] Web App Development
- [ ] Deployment
